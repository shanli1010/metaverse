     <center>THE METAVERSE</center>
     </h1>

     <p>
       <center>Is the metaverse going to completely transform our perceived definition of reality? Capitalism has come far these days, and now we’re going so far as to capitalize thoughts and ideas through the metaverse and NFTs. In many of the superbowl commercials, companies even recognize this new surge in interest of the metaverse. Some commercials encouraged it, others warned against it in hopes you buy their product to prevent this new technology. How does that seem humane? ‘Buy my product out of fear, or simply live in fear.’
       	The term NFTs has circulated around me quite often, especially because of the major I chose at Tandon. As an Integrated Digital Media major, NFTs seem like a dream come true. A form of freelancing that can be purchased as “stock”, selling for checks with however many zeroes society deems fit. Yet some NFT platforms require a gas fee, and some are sold at the cost of a clean environment. I’m still a little hazy on how it all works, but I know that NFTs take a lot of computer power to upkeep and track the ownership of each work of art. Due to this fact, each “computer” or PC has to remain on 24/7, utilizing a lot of fossil fuels in the process. My question now is, if NFTs creates gas emissions, further ruining our environment, is that a capitalistic push to encourage the use of the metaverse, or even the push to move to mars? Are the big tech companies creating problems so they can be seen as heroes when they provide solutions?
