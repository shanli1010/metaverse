     <center>THE METAVERSE</center>
     </h1>

     <p>
       <center>Is the metaverse going to completely transform our perceived definition of reality? Capitalism has come far these days, and now we’re going so far as to capitalize thoughts and ideas through the metaverse and NFTs. In many of the superbowl commercials, companies even recognize this new surge in interest of the metaverse. Some commercials encouraged it, others warned against it in hopes you buy their product to prevent this new technology. How does that seem humane? ‘Buy my product out of fear, or simply live in fear.’
